# HTL-ETL Kontakt
Created: 2021-12-1015:59
In Cells G1963 and G1974 cells were manufactured without the perovskite over a specific layer.

In regions without the perovskite, ETL and HTL are in direct contact, thus forming a semiconductor, semiconductor heterojunction.

Here a Type I semiconductor heterojunction forms, both electrons and holes need additional energy to go from the material with a smaller bandgap to the material with a larger bandgap (from C60 to HTL). Is the C60 or BCP important/dominating?

Because of the difference in chemical potentials of the Au and ITO, a built in potential exists. This potential drop occurs where??? In thickest layer, eg BCP?
