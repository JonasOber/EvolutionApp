## Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSC) with different bathocuproine (BCP) layer thicknesses have been fabricated and analyzed by J-V and C-V measurements. Maximum efficiency of 17 % has been obtained for 5 nm BCP, while thinner oder thicker layers promote charge accumulation and performance degradation.

## Fabrication
All layers were fabricated by wet chemical methods, only the BCP was thermally evaporated.
PSC layout is comparable to our layouts (Glass-FTO-MAPbI3-PCBM-BCP-Ag).

## Results and discussion
10 samples of the same thickness were fabricated and analyzed. 
For layer thicknesses up to 5 nm, PCE, Jsc and FF all increase, because of decreasing series resistance with thicker BCP layer. Too thick layers (> 5 nm) lead to an increase of series resistance, and PCE, Jsc and FF drop.
S-shaped J-V curves apper in both 0 nm and 13 nm thick BCP, implying to different barriers ([1]). Meanwhile Voc stays nearly constant for all different BCP thicknesses under 5 nm and decreases from 5 nm to 13 nm. The increase for larger BCP thicknesses is attributed to increased electron-hole recombination at the BCP/PCBM interface.
To evaluate the thickness influence on PSC parameters, the J-V curves are fit with the single diode model. Here series resistance decreases with layer thickness up to 5 nm and then increases significantly. Shunt resistance shows a maximum at 5 nm.

This effect is explained because BCP changes the Schottky contact between PCBM and Ag to an ohmic contact. At the schottky contact, the LUMO level between PCBM and Ag shows an offset 0.1-0.4 eV, decreasing Jsc by a small amount (19.67-21.11 mA cm^-2). Inserting BCP reduces the Ohmic Contact, decreases charge accumulation and therby increases shunt resistance. Thicker layers show worse performance, because of the low conductivity of BCP, decreasing shunt resistance, because of charge accumulation at the PCBM and BCP layer and increased recombination.

At the optimal layer thickness of 5 nm, BCP covers PCBM fully but charges are still able to tunnel across the layer.

### CV Measurements
CV measurements show that all devices show increased capacitance for voltages larger 0.8 V (exponential increase).  0 nm BCP shows a peak at 1 V, while 13 nm show a gentle peak at 0.6 V, indicating different charge accumulation mechanisms. 

### Stability
The performance indicated by PCE was measured multiple times over the duration of many hours. The BCP device with 5 nm shows and 8 times the T_80 lifetime (Time when PCE reaches 80 % of it's initial value). BCP thus greatly increases device stability. 
The devices were soaked in water for 10 mins and degradation optically observed. BCP increases lifetime up to 50 times.
