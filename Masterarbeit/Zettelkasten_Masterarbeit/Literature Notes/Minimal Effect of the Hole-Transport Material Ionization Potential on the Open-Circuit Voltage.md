#  Minimal Effect of the Hole-Transport Material Ionization Potential on the Open-Circuit Voltage
Created: 2021-11-2913:47
Hole Transport materials are designed to have Ionization Potentials (IPs) as close to the perovsite as possible. Higher Ionization Potentials correlate with a higher Voc.
Processing the perovskite in an inverted structure (perovskite ontop of HTM), the HTM serves as a substrate and affects the perovskite's morphology and grain size. For this reason the cells in [1] are processed with HTM ontop of perovskite.
TPD forms an extraction barrier at the perovskite/HTM interface which resultes in a S-shaped IV curve (Ref. 34).
The Voc of the perovskite solar cell is unaffected by small variations of IP and work function of HTMs. This trend was observed too in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical cells, where performance and Voc of the devices are independet of work function and redox potential (IP?). Ionic accumulation at the semiconductor surface that the voltage drops entirely over the ionic layer instead over the perovskite bulk.
