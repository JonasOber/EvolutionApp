Charge carriers diffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration and also drift due to the built-in electric field.
Paper is about fullerene compounds (C60) increasing PSC device performance by efficiently extracting electrons from the perovskite layer.
In this paper devices with Pero-BCP and Pero-C60-BCP with 1 nm, 20 nm C60 were studied numerically. 	
Electrons travel from the perovskite to bcp to ag over gap states formed by Ag diffusion.
In this work the pero-C60 interface was assumed to have a high electron mobility and inside the C60 the electron mobility to be low. This decreases the performance in thicker layers of C60. Less efficient carrier mobility at the pero-bcp interface is modeled by reduced mobility in a 0.5 nm region.
This work furthermore assumed no ion movement, because in C60 devices no JV hysteresis was found. This means that the hysteresis is more likely due to space charge effects (Ref. 9).
To confirm the assumptions of different carrier mobility at the interfaces, the JV curve for different perovskite interface mobilities and interface trap densities was simulated. This shows that a higher interface mobility leads to an increase in short circuit current, while the trap states mostly affect the open connect voltage. Fitting the measurement data for no C60 layer an interface mobility of 5e-13 m^2/Vs was estimated.
This analysis supports Ref. 9, only adding BCP to a perovskite doesn't reduce PL intensity, but in addition with C60 results in quenched fluorescence, signaling a lower charge density.
A possible explanation for low carrier mobility at the perovskite-BCP interface could be a back-to-back Schottky contact (Ref. 26), but this doesn't result in the experimental observations. Another explanation could be a difference of the pero and bcp material on the molecular level.
The origin of S-shaped JV measurements lies in interface dipoles, charge accumulation, injection or extraction barriers, imbalanced mobilities and poor extraction of electrons due to low interface mobilities.
