Created: 2021-12-0914:43

The low formation energy of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites enable processing at low temperatures, are however prone to chemical transformations under small external influence. Dispite the usage of inert materials like Au, at perovskite/Au interfaces rapid degradation to PbI2 occurs upon voltage bias. This supports the mechanicsm of H2 and I2 generation at the cathode and anode [1].
Nearyl all halide perovskite components, including H+, PB2+ and halide anions are known to participate in UPD reactions (Ref. 23-28).
In this work the formation of UPD Pb and I is studied:
1. PbI2 and MAPbI3 films with thick (50 nm) Au coatings are studied by XPS, to proof the evidence of UPD species.

2. Samples with thin Au films to characterize reactions occuring at the interface.
3. J-V measurements on ITO/MAPbI3/Au devices.

Photoelectronspectroscopy have electrons with mean free paths smaller than 10 nm, but despite the thick Au layer, Pb and I species are detected. Continuous XPS measurements show a shift in binding energy to 137.4 eV, corrpesonding to UPD Pb.
The measurement of I 3d spectra show similar peaks in MAPbI3/Au and PbI2/Au, with different degradation characteristics. MAPbI3/Au shows a significant loss of I3 intensity over time, the iodide loss likely happening as HI, while the absence of protons in PbI2 hinders HI formation, showing no loss of iodine peak intensity.
The reactants at Au surface are: Pb, I, H +
UPD reactions are known for Pb, iodine and H+. 
The following degradation pathway of MAPbI3/Au during XPS is proposed:
- Electrons are released upon adsorption of I^0_UPD onto Au, producing PbI2 and methylammonium (CH3NH4)
- proton from methylammonium adsorbs onto the Au aurface, captures the free electrons and liberates methylamine (CH3NH3)
- Adsorbed I^0_UPD and H^0_UPD react to HI, H2, I2..
- Cycle repeates and more PbI2, HI, organic species and Pb^0_UPD are formed.

At the ITO-MAPbI3 interface, reactions or ions accumulate and increase non-radiative recombination (Fig S13).
ITO/MAPbI3/Au devices were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and showed peaks in the range of -0.5 V < V < 0.9 V. Integration of the peak give surface concentrations of around 1e14 cm$^{-2}$. Extending the applied voltages to lower/ higher voltages, quick device degradation is observed.

The devices show switchable photovoltaic properties, reversing the diode polarity once reaching 1 V, corresponding to the electrochemical threshold voltages and thus electrochemical potentials (? - what does i mean?). 
Ion diffusion without electrochemical reactions at the interfaces show basic RC models, not "Real" behaviour.
This paper shows a "save" window for ITO/MAPbI3/Au operations of -0.5 V to 0.9 V, with reversible surface reactions. Higher voltages induce reactions and rapid degradation.

##Terms
- underpotential deposition (UPD): surface adsorption reaction at which an ion changes oxidation state upon adsorption
- cyclic voltammetry: voltage - current measurement to define species bei their oxidation/ reduction potential

##Questions 
- IV Messung bis zu höheren Spannungen machen? In EL legen wir bis zu 2 V an, da sollten Ionen/ Reaktionen an den Kontakten stattfinden, was man vielleicht in einer Änderung der IV Kennlinie erkennt?
