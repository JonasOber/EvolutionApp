# 2019 Reactions at noble metal contacts with methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites
Created: 2021-12-0914:43

The low formaiton energy of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites enable processing at low temperatures, are however prone to chemical transformations under small external influence. Dispite the usage of inert materials like Au, at perovskite/Au interfaces rapid degradation to PbI2 occurs upon voltage bias. This supports the mechanicsm of H2 and I2 generation at the cathode and anode [1].
