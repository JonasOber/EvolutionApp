Instability of perovskites is divided into intrinsic and nonintrinsic instability. Intrinsic instability is device degradation under light and electric fields. Nonintrinsic instability occurs with external induced factors, like moisture, heat, oxygen, uv light. These could be adressed by model encapsulation. 
In this work ion migration for hopping over vacant ions is studied. All atom species present in MAPbI3 are able to migrate with different energy barriers: I- with 0.33 eV, MA+ with 0.55 eV and Pb2+ with 2.31 eV (Ref 41 and 43). This means that both I- and MA+ are diffusable at room temperature. The diffusion coefficient of I- was estimated to be 1e-12 cm^2/s at 300 K.
Diffusion over interstitial defects and grain boundaries is not studied here.
Ion migration already occurs at electric field strengths of 0.3 V/um or lower (Ref. 45-47). In MaPbIBr mixtures the halides split into I and Br rich regions, iodine rich domains showing a lower bandgap and thus decreasing Voc and shifting the PL. This shift is observed after serveral seconds, a timescale corresponding to ionic motion. Ions drift from the bulk to the interfaces, screening the inside. This needs a larger voltage to keep the current constant and leads to a decrease in PL intensity, because of an increase of defect states. The halide distribution into I and Br rich domains is further supported by a red shift of PL signal at the anode and blue shift at the cathode (Ref 52). Iodine vacancies and MA+ interstitials (both positive) can act as p-doping and I- interstitials and MA+ vacancies as n-doping (Ref 38, 60). 
Mobile MA+ Ions can diffuse into the (soft) HTL, causing degradation.
Ref 68 shows that humidity can greatly enhance ion migration. This is explaned by the bonding of H2O to MA+, which decreases the interaction of MA+ with the PbI6 octahedron and thus facilitates MA+ migration.
Under light illumination a growing number of pinholes and dendrites (PbI2) formed, because under strong light large numbers of I- migrated towards the cathode and formed I2. (THIS DOES What to the film?) MA+ migrates to the anode and evaporates as CH3NH2 gas (pinholes) and MAPbI3 changes to PbI2. Cryogenic galvanostatic measurements at low temperatures showed that light reduces the activation energy for ion diffusion.
Changing the perovskite to CsPbI2Br showed no dendrite formation, even under large intensities and the barrier for Cs ion migration remains constant at 0.45 eV.
Increasing grain boundaries and inversly smaller grain size correlates to a smaller ion migration energy barrier and thus more IV hystersis.
Ref 99 studied perovskite degradation under strain by manufacturing concave (reduce) and convex (enhance) layers. After 500 h illumination a large part of the convex film turned yellow, showing increasing degradation with more strain. Strain forms at an applied voltage or stacking layers with different thermal expansion coefficients.

To reduce ion migration ions in the bulk (K+) and surface (Cl-) were incorporated. For the selective carrier transport layers ion blocking materials might be beneficial.
