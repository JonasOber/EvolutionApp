# 2019 The Role of Interfaces in perovskite solar cells

## The Role of Interfaces

Light is absorbed in the perovskite layer and generates excitons. Because of the small effective exciton binding energy and the high permittivity of perovskite, the exciton spreads quickly into free electrons and holes. Photogenerated free electrons and holes drift to the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces due to the built in electric field.
At the interfaces more recombination occurs: Recombination over interface defects and radiative recombination, because of increased carrier densities at interfaces.

##Questions 
- Calculate exciton radius for perovskite parameters and show that in general free electrons and holes. What does this mean for the radiative recombination?
- Built in electric field from work function differences in materials? Built in field not screened by free charges?
