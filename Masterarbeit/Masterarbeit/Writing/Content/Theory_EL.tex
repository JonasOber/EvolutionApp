\chapter{Theory of Electroluminescence}
This chapter explains the theoretical background of Electroluminescence (EL). Starting with the rate of radiating recombination, depending on the material's band structure (see section XY). The rate depends on the carrier concentration, so section XY explains the carrier density profile. Section XY ends with the light path of the radiation out of the sample.
