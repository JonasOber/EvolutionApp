\chapter{Setup}
This chapter presents the experimental setup for electroluminescence measurements. Successful EL measurements consist of injecting charges into the recombination layer, charges recombining and detecting the emitted luminescence. Therefore, \autoref{sec:GeneralSetup} explaines the general setup used for EL measurements. \autoref{sec:electricalconnection} explains the Perovskite Cell layout and electrical contacting of the cells, which is used to inject charges into the perovskite layer. Optics focus and a camera measures the EL intensity (see \autoref{sec:luminescencedetection}). The chapter concludes with the consideration of noise and measurement errors.

\section{General Setup}\label{sec:GeneralSetup}
The setup is enclosed in a black housing, shielding the inside from outside light and noise (see \autoref{fig:generalsetup}). All parts inside the chamber are painted black to minimize internal reflections and thereby the detection of stray light. A vacuum pump, voltage source, multimeter and operating table with a computer are connected to the setup from the outside, providing further utility. Inside the enclosure are the probe holder and the camera. The camera is mounted on rails and can be moved in three dimensions, enabling position according to used optics and samples.

\section{Electrical Connection}\label{sec:electricalconnection}
Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) are manufactured on 25 mm x 25 mm glass substrates (see \autoref{fig:perolayouttop}). Four cells are deposited on one substrate, each single cell having an active area of 4 mm x 3.5 mm. The cell stack consists of a 0.7 mm thick glass substrate, with a 100 nm thick layer of indium tin oxide (short ITO) deposited on top. The ITO is structured by laser ablation, isolating individual cells from each other. Onto the ITO, 10 nm of Spiro-TTB is deposited as a hole transport layer (HTL), followed by 500 nm of methylammonium lead triiodide (short MAPI) as the absorbing material. The top side of the MAPI is contacted with 8 nm of fullerene (short: C$_{60}$) and 23 nm bathocuproine (short: BCP), acting as the electron transport layer (short ETL). In the end of the fabrication process, 100 nm Gold are deposited by thermal vapor deposition on top of the ITO and the C$_{60}$ and BCP. To successfully contact the PSC a holder with four pins is used. The PSC is positioned face down, with the glass substrate above, onto the holder, positioning the gold pads on all contacts. The holder uses two pins to check proper contacting of the PSC and the other two to source voltage.

\end{figure}

The holder is electrically connected to a power supply\footnote{Kukusuki}, in series with a 100 m$\Omega$ resistance, R, and two multimeters\footnote{Keithley 2000 Multimeter} (see \autoref{fig:generalsetup}). One multimeter measures the voltage drop across the PSC. The other multimeter measures the voltage drop across the resistor and the flowing current I is then calculated using Ohm's law:
\begin{equation}
	I = \frac{U}{R}.
\end{equation}
The surface of the holder is structured with rills and connected to a vacuum pump, fixing the PSC on the holder by a vacuum, ensuring mechanical- and electrical contact stability throughout the measurement.

This setup enables safe contact of the probes inside the enclosure and enables reliable EL measurements.

\section{Luminescence detection}\label{sec:luminescencedetection}
In the setup a CCD camera is used to detect the emitted electroluminescence. The camera detects radiation over a wide range of wavelengths, while the perovskite emits luminescence only at a relatively short range of wavelengths. Therefore, filters are used to detect only EL radiation. Optics focus the emitted radiation at a specific distance onto the imaging sensor. This chapter explains the used components and physical processes.
\subsection{Filters}
Between probe and sensor two low pass filters\footnote{LP714, LP718} are used to filter the wavelengths reaching the detector. In filters absorption or interference are used to either transmit or reflect specific wavelengths. The filters in the setup are chosen accordingly to the luminescence emission spectrum of the PSC (see \autoref{fig:spectrum_perofilter}). This limits the detection of wavelengths to above 718 nm, while limiting the detection of stray light with shorter wavelengths. The filters are part of the photoluminescence capability of the setup, where light emitting diodes (LEDs) optically generate charges in the perovskite. To only detect luminescence from the perovskite, both filters block light emitted by the LEDs.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Optics}
Optics focus the radiation onto a charge coupled sensor (CCD). This setup uses a lens\footnote{Pentax, C2514-M (KP)} with a focus length of 25 mm and an aperature of 1.4, as listed by the manufacturer. The lens is positioned at the minimal object distance of  25 cm away from the PSC. A extender \footnote{Brennweitenverdoppler C - Mount 2-EX / FP-EX2} is mounted directly between camera and lens, with a C-mount, doubling the resultion, however decreasing the intensity reaching the camera.

\subsection{Charge Coupled Detectors}
The radiation is focused onto a charge coupled device (CCD) image sensor\footnote{Sony ICX285-AL} in a camera\footnote{PCO, sensicam qe}. CCD sensors are silicon chips structured into small squares, called wells \cite{SchnellCCD1993}(see \autoref{fig:ccdsensor}). The number of wells correspond to the number of pixel in the taken picture. Radiation generates charges, electrons and holes, and externally applied voltages seperate and trap the charges in the wells. For a specific duration, called exposure time, radiation hits the sensor and charges accumulate in the wells. The amount of generated electrons per incoming photon is called the quantum efficiency (QE), and depends on the sensor material and energy of the photon. The QE for the chosen sensor peaks at 500 nm and decays for larger wavelengths (compare \autoref{fig:pcosensicamqe}). For the wavelengths transmitted by the filter (see \autoref{fig:spectrum_perofilter}), the QE drops to about 10 \%, which limits the sensitivity. After the exposure time a series of voltages is applied to shift the charges from the light sensitive wells to opaque covered wells. Then the charges are extracted row by row and the voltage of each well is measured. An A/D converter convertes the voltage into a digital signal, which is saved and later processed. Optical fibers connect the camera to a computer and the software LabView processes the acquired pictures. The software enables automatic control of the setup and acquisition of multiple images with different settings in a row.

This process measures the EL distribution over the PSC surface. However, several sources of errors occur, which are discussed in the next section.

\section{Noise and measurement errors}
Several sources of errors deviate the measured signal from the physical value. Common errors in the camera image acquisition are dark noise, readout noise and hot or cold pixel (see \autoref{table:CCDcamera}). Dark noise refers to the thermal generation of electrons, depending on the temperature and the material's properties. To reduce thermal generation the CCD sensor is cooled to -12 \textdegree C. To further reduce dark noise, images without illumination or applied voltage are taken, and subtracted from the EL image.\\

Readout noise occurs, when the electrons are shifted from well to well. The manufacturer specifies a read out noise of 5 electrons. This relates to about two counts, with an analog to digital conversion efficiency of 2 electrons per count \cite{ManualSensicam}. EL images are taken at around 3000 counts, 75 \% of the possible 4096 counts, showing that readout noise can in most cases be neglected. A maximum of two pixels are hot pixels, showing more than 5 electrons,  \\
