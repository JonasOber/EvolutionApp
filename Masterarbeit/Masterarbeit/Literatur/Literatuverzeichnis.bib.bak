  abstract = {Abstract Tandem solar cells are the next step in the photovoltaic (PV) evolution due to their higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) potential than currently dominating, but inherently limited, single-junction solar cells. With the emergence of metal halide perovskite absorber materials, the fabrication of highly efficient tandem solar cells, at a reasonable cost, can significantly impact the future PV landscape. The perovskite-based tandem solar cells have already shown that they can convert light more efficiently than their standalone sub-cells. However, to reach PCEs over 30\%, several challenges have to be overcome and the understanding of this fascinating technology has to be broadened. In this review, the main scientific and engineering challenges in the field are presented, alongside a discussion of the current status of three main perovskite tandem technologies: perovskite/silicon, perovskite/CIGS, and perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells. A summary of the advanced structural, electrical, optical, radiative, and electronic characterization methods as well as simulations being utilized for perovskite-based tandem solar cells is presented. The main findings are summarized and the strength of the techniques to overcome the challenges and gain deeper knowledge for further performance improvement is assessed. Finally, the PCE potential in different experimental and theoretical limits is compared with an aim to shed light on the path towards overcoming the 30\% efficiency threshold for all of the three herein reviewed tandem technologies.},

  abstract = {Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites such as methyl ammonium lead halides are attractive as low-cost light-emitting diode (LED) emitters. This is because, unlike many inorganic nanomaterials, they have very high color purity. Cho et al. made two modifications to address the main drawback of these materials, their low luminescent efficiency. They created nanograin materials lacking free metallic lead, which helped to confine excitons and avoid their quenching. The perovskite LEDs had a current efficiency similar to that of phosphorescent organic LEDs. Science, this issue p. 1222 Efficient organic-inorganic perovskite light-emitting diodes were made with nanograin crystals that lack metallic lead. Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are emerging low-cost emitters with very high color purity, but their low luminescent efficiency is a critical drawback. We boosted the current efficiency (CE) of perovskite light-emitting diodes with a simple bilayer structure to 42.9 candela per ampere, similar to the CE of phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes, with two modifications: We prevented the formation of metallic lead (Pb) atoms that cause strong exciton quenching through a small increase in methylammonium bromide (MABr) molar proportion, and we spatially confined the exciton in uniform MAPbBr3 nanograins (average diameter = 99.7 nanometers) formed by a nanocrystal pinning process and concomitant reduction of exciton diffusion length to 67 nanometers. These changes caused substantial increases in steady-state photoluminescence intensity and efficiency of MAPbBr3 nanograin layers.},

  abstract = {Abstract An important aspect when upscaling organic photovoltaics from laboratory to industrial scale is quality control. Established imaging techniques like lock-in thermography or luminescence imaging are frequently used for this purpose. While these techniques allow for the lateral detection of defects, they cannot provide information on the vertical position of the defect in the OPV stack. Here, we present an approach to overcome this limitation. A femtosecond-laser is deployed to introduce well-defined artificial calibration defects selectively into both the interface and the bulk active layer of inverted P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction cells during device fabrication. The defective cells are then characterized using J-V analysis and several nondestructive imaging methods (dark lock-in thermography, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence imaging). The distinct response for each defect in the different imaging methods enables us to uniquely distinguish between bulk and interface defects. This allows to study surface recombination under most controlled conditions.},
