Spiro-TTB = 2,2',7,7'-tetra (N,N-di-tylyl)amino-9,9-spirobifluorene 
Hole Transport Materials are selected for high hole mobilities and high visible transparencies. The hole mobility of Spiro-TTB was measured using space charge limited current (SCLC) to about 1.97e-3 cm^2/(Vs).  HTMs with thicknesses of only few tens of nanometers need moblity higher than 1e-5 cm^2/(Vs). 
Important for processing PSCs is the (solution) processability and crystal morphology of the perovskite layer. Surface energy of the interfaces is important for perovskite layer processing.
Spiro compounds and perovskites were deposited via thermal evaporation but showed low device performance (Ref. 33-35).
PSCs were fabricated in an inverted device architecture. The Processed perovskite showed mainly vertically aligned grains, beneficial for charge transport because of minimal recombination at grain boundaries.
The HOMO potential of Spiro TTB was determined to 5.3 eV and the LUMO by E_HOMO-E_gap to 2.23 eV. 
PSC with efficiencies up to 18 %, 1.07 V Voc and Jsc of 22.02 mA/cm^-2 were fabricated.
TTB seems to be the promising HTM, because of 100 mV higher Voc, compared to other Spiro HTMs. To understand this origin, crystal morphology of the perovskite and charge transfer dynamics were looked at:
- Quality of MAPbI3 films grown on different HTMs is almost identical
- Charge transfer dynamics were analyzed by photoluminescence and time resolved PL. Intensity of Pero on bare glass highest and intensity strongy diminished by HTM, most by Spiro-TTB. This shows efficient hole extraction and transport from perovskite to HTM.
- TRPL shows carrier lifetimes of 4.7 ns for Spiro-TTB, lowest of the three Spiro-HTMs. Shows moest efficient hole extraction capability.
- Transient photovoltage decay shows decay time of 135 us for TTB, longest of three spiro HTMs. Longer Decay means slower charge recombination at the interfaces.
Doped TTB was processed and used in a PSC. However dopant-inducecd interfacial recombination limits charge carrier lifetime and thus reduces PSC efficiency.
