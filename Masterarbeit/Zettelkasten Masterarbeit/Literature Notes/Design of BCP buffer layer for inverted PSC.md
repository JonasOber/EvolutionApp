# Design of BCP buffer layer for inverted PSC
Created: 2021-11-2915:03
To improve the conversion efficiency of PSCs it is required to efficienty seperate electrons and holes, generated in the perovskite layer. Therefore hole and electron transport materials are used.
Electron transport materials such as C60 require a buffer layer to prevent recombination between the electron transport layer and the metal electrode. BCP is introduced as a buffer layer with the ETL PCBM.
Including BCP layers up to 2 nm increasing PCE,  for thicknesses up to 5 nm. This is because BCP reduces the contact between PCBM and Ag, which form a Schottky contact. Including BCP changes this to an ohmic contact. For layer thicknesses over 5 nm, recombination occury at the perovskite/PCBM interface, as the layer resistance of BCP increases.
