The Electron Transport Layer (ETL) or Electron Transport Material (ETM) is used to selectively extract only electrons from the perovskite layer. Materials are selected depending on their LUMO and HOMO energy. Herefore the conduction band should be matched to the perovskite's conduction band, resulting in a low barrier for electrons. Additionally there should be a large energy offset between the perovskite's LUMO and the ETL's LUMO, minimizing hole injection into the ETL. SOURCE
Used materials are BCP in combination with C60. The BCP layer provides high electron mobility [1], however electron transport is assumed to occur through defect states. Furthermore the perovskite-bcp interface shows low interface mobility, thus reducing device performance [2]. For this reason a layer of few nm C60 is included between the perovskite and the BCP. The interface pero-C60 shows much higher interface mobility [2].
